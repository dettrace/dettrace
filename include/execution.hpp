/**
 * Execution class.
 * This class handles the event driven loop that is a process execution. Events from
 * a running program are intercepted, and a handler is called for that event.
 * Events include: clone, execve, fork, vfork, signal received, and system calls.

 * This class replaces the original code which
 * was a while loop with a `Event e = getNextEvent(...);` with several cases to handle
 * different types of events. The control flow logic became complicated, with gotos,
 * breaks, continues. Just as bad, the code could not be refactored into functions as
 * there was too many variables in scope.

 * Hence we took all those variables and turned them into fields of this class.
 * Each function handles a certain type of event, with many many side effects.
